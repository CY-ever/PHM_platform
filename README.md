Bearing PHM Online Toolbox Platform
Overview
This project is an online toolbox platform for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) of bearings, developed using Python. It is designed to run on Ubuntu systems and is currently intended for educational and research purposes only.

PHM is a vast and intricate field that includes signal generation, data augmentation, signal denoising, feature extraction, data selection, signal dimensionality reduction, and bearing fault diagnosis and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction based on machine learning and deep learning.

Researchers working in any of these areas often need to utilize functionalities from other domains, which can significantly reduce research efficiency. Thus, developing an integrated online toolbox platform that encompasses the entire PHM process can greatly shorten development time and reduce costs. This platform is valuable for both teaching and research in the PHM field.
